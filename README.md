# meteor-js-autoform-tutorial
Based on the project by Web Tempest

A simple example of how to use meteor autoform with collection 2

Link to tutorial http://www.webtempest.com/meteor-js-autoform-tutorial

Main change: I use "Items" instead of "Posts" for the main collection in the tutorial and I changed the field names.


RS:

- doc=this has to be added to the update autoform
- meteor remove accounts-google
- meteor add accounts-password
- meteor add msavin:mongol (ctrl-m to get a mongo db popup)
